# Systems Analysis

## Robot Design

### Drive Base

Our robot is driven by two powered colson wheels and supported at a third point by a free spinning omni-wheel. 

### Lifting Mechanism

In order to lift the pallet steadily and evenly, we will implement a scissor-lift driven by a lead screw. One foot of the scissor lift will be fixed whilst the lead screw will drive the other. By pushing this dynamic foot towards to away from the fixed foot, the top of the scissor lift will rise or fall to lift or set-down the pallet.
